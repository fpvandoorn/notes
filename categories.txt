Can we define the 1-category of univalent categories in type theory? We can make the 2-category, but
the 1-category is useful to define e.g. higher categories in terms of enriched categories.

Cat = univalent categories
sCat = strict categories

Rezk completion, R : sCat → Cat
0-truncating objects, T : Cat → sCat

Given C C' : Cat and D D' : sCat, F : C -> C', G : D -> D', we can define
C → T C. We cannot define T C → C
D → R D. Can we define R D → D?
T F : T C → T C'
R G : R D → R D'

There is probably an adjunction (2-adjunction?) in here.
